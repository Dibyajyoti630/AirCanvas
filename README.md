# AirCanvas
AirCanvas is an innovative virtual writing tool that enables users to write or draw in the air without any 
physical touch. Utilizing advanced computer vision and hand gesture recognition technologies, this project 
creates an interactive and touch-free interface for digital drawing. By leveraging OpenCV for real-time 
webcam access and MediaPipe for accurate hand gesture detection, AirCanvas provides a seamless and 
intuitive user experience. The system also includes essential functionalities like clearing the canvas, undoing 
strokes, erasing content, and changing pen colors. This project is particularly useful for artists, educators, and 
individuals who require an intuitive, touch-free writing or drawing solution
